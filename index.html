				<span class="font-bold">Javascript - Node.JS Backend</span>
				<p>
					Javascript is my favorite programming language due to it's simple syntax and it's simple way to act with APIs all around the world.<br />
					It also has functionalities to do backend and frontend both at the same time such as using Socket.IO or React frameworks such as React.JS itself, Next.JS and more!

				<span class="font-bold">Python - Machine Learning and AI</span>
				<p>
					I used to code Python back in the day and I am trying to learn it again for the use of machine learning and AI such as Text generation AI, Multimodal AI and more with Real Time Object Detection being one of them.<br />
					Python serves some great uses but also lacks some speed. Google made a package called Tensorflow which has native support on Python and a crossed support to Javascript which doesn't work that well to this day.

				<span class="font-bold">Java - Minecraft Modding</span>
				<p>
					I love Java due to the point that Minecraft exists, if Minecraft didn't exist I wouldn't like Java, Java is used in many libraries due to it's way of making executables across every platform (.jar)<br/>
					When I play Minecraft I often play Modded Minecraft which serves the propose of me coding in Java for Minecraft Plugins and Mods.
